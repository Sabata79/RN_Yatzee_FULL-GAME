Welcome to My React Native Yatzy Game!

I am a software development student at Oulu University of Applied Sciences, and this project started as part of my coursework. The initial idea came from a class exercise where I needed to create an application with rotating dices that could be selected by tapping on the desired dice.
From there, I decided to transform it into a complete Yatzy game.

This project has grown into a personal hobby, and I’ve been developing it at my own pace without pressure. The goal is to create a smooth and enjoyable experience for anyone who loves the classic game of Yatzy.

I hope you enjoy playing my React Native Yatzy Game as much as I enjoyed developing it. Feel free to reach out if you have any suggestions or feedback!
