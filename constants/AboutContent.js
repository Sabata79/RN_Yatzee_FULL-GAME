Welcome to this React Native Yatzy Game!

This project started as a simple coursework assignment, using React Native and Expo as the foundation. What began with a basic dice-rolling feature—where users could tap to select dice—has since evolved into a fully functional and polished Yatzy game.

Over time, the game has grown beyond its initial scope, incorporating native functionality to enhance features, improve performance, and deliver a smoother player experience. Development has been a steady journey of learning, exploration, and refining to create something both fun and engaging.

Enjoy rolling the dice, and feel free to share your thoughts or suggestions.

It ensures that your game data is securely stored in the cloud, allowing you to access your progress from any device. If you don't link your account, your progress is stored locally on your device only, which may lead to data loss if your device is lost or damaged.`;
