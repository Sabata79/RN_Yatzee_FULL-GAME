Welcome to this React Native Yatzy Game!

This project started as part of a coursework assignment, where we explored React Native with Expo. The concept began with a simple dice-rolling feature, where users could select dice by tapping on them.

Over time, the project evolved into a fully functional Yatzy game. It has been developed at a steady pace, with a focus on learning and creating an enjoyable experience for players.

Enjoy the game and feel free to share any thoughts or suggestions you might have!
