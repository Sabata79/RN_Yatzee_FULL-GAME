Welcome to this React Native Yatzy Game!

This project started as a simple coursework assignment, using React Native and Expo as the foundation. What began with a basic dice-rolling feature—where users could tap to select dice—has since evolved into a fully functional and polished Yatzy game.

Over time, the game has grown beyond its initial scope, incorporating native functionality to enhance features, improve performance, and deliver a smoother player experience. Development has been a steady journey of learning, exploration, and refining to create something both fun and engaging.

Enjoy rolling the dice, and feel free to share your thoughts or suggestions.
